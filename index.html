                <p>Formula One (also Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and owned by the Formula One Group.
                    The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950.
                    The 'formula' in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform.
                    A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix (French for 'grand prizes' or 'great prizes'), which are held worldwide on purpose-built circuits and public roads.

                <p>Group B was a set of regulations introduced in 1982 for competition vehicles in sportscar racing and rallying regulated by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).
                    The Group B regulations fostered some of the fastest, most powerful, and most sophisticated rally cars ever built and is commonly referred to as the golden era of rallying.
                    However, a series of major accidents, some of them fatal, were blamed on their outright speed and lack of crowd control at events. After the death of Henri Toivonen and his co-driver Sergio Cresto in the 1986 Tour de Corse, the FIA disestablished the class, dropped its previous plans to replace it by Group S, and instead replaced it as the top-line formula by Group A.
                    The short-lived Group B era has acquired legendary status among rally fans and automobile enthusiasts in general.
